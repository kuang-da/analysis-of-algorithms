\section{Graphics Basics}
\begin{itemize}
\item A graph G is an ordered pair of two sets $(V, E)$.
\item $V$ is a set of vertices/points/nodes, which is always a finite set.
\item $E$ is a set of unordered pair of vertices.
\item An edge is represented as $(u ,v)$. Here we abuse the notion of ordered 
pair to represent unordered pair.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Two representation of Graph}
When we talked about graph without adjective, that mean it is a 
undirected graph. Suppose the number of vertices is $|V| = n$.
\begin{itemize}
 \item A vertex is incident to an edge if the vertex is one of the two vertices 
the edge connects.
\item If an edge $(u, v)$ has end points $u$ and $v$, we say it is an incident 
to vertex $u$ and $v$.
\item $u$, $v$ are adjacent if $(u, v) \in \mathbb{E}$.
\item The degree of vertex $v$ is the number of edges incident on $v$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Adjacency Matrix}
Adjacency Matrix is an sysmetric matrix for undirected graph where
\[
V_{ij} = 
\begin{cases*}
 |(i,j)| & ,\text{ if $(i,j) \in \mathbb{E}$.}\\
 0  &,\text{ otherwise.}
\end{cases*}
\]
\subsubsection{Adjacency List}
Adjacency List is an array of size n of linked list, where $i$-th entry is 
a linked list consisting of the neighbos of vertex-$i$. It is default 
representation of graph.

Space = $O(n + m)$
\subsection{Connectivity}
\subsubsection{Path}
A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices
\[v_0 v_1 \cdots v_k\]
, such that $(v_i, v_{i+1}) \in \mathbb{E}$ for $i = 0, 1, 2, \cdots, k-1$
A simple path is a path that does not repeat vertices.
\paragraph{Lemma:}
If there is a path $(u, v)$, there must be a simple path $(u, v)$.
\subsubsection{Cycle}
A cycle in a graph is a sequence of vertices
\[v_0 v_1 \cdots v_kv_0\]
, such that $(v_i, v_{i+1}) \in \mathbb{E}$ for $i = 0, 1, 2, \cdots, k-1$ and 
$(v_k, v_{0}) \in \mathbb{E}$. All $v_i$s are distinct.

\subsubsection{Connectivity}
\begin{itemize}
 \item $u$, $v$ is \textbf{connected} if there is a path between them.
 \item $G$ is \textbf{connected} if $\forall u, v \in V$, there is a path 
between $u$ and $v$.
\item The \textbf{connected components} of $G$ are maximal subset of vertices 
that are pairwise connected.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Connection is equivalence relation}
Connection relation in a graph is an equivalence relation.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Reflexive Relation (take Path of length 0)
 \item Symmetric Relation (reversible path)
 \item Transitive Relation: If a Graph has a $uv$ path and also $vw$ path then 
it will also contain $uw$ path.
\end{itemize}
Because connnection is the equivalence relation, pairwise connected vertices 
form a connected component.
\section{Tree}
Tree is a connected acyclic graph.
\subsection{Rooted tree}
\subsubsection{Inductive Defintion}
A nice thing about Inductive defintion is it is useful for the proofs by 
induction.
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Rule 1:} A graph consist of a single vertex v is a rooted tree 
with v as the root.
 \item \textbf{Rule 2:} If $(T_1, r_1)$, $(T_2, r_2), \cdot, (T_k, r_k)$ are 
rooted trees, then the tree $(T, r)$ consisting of a new node $r$ as root and 
edges $(r, r_1), \cdots, (r, r_k)$ is a rooted tree.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Structural induction Proof}
Statement: Any tree with $n$ nodes has $n-1$ edges.

Since any tree can be transformed into a rooted tree, the induction can be as 
following:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Statement: Any rooted tree on $n$ nodes has $n-1$ edges.
 \item Base case: Single node tree with no edge. The statement is true.
 \item Inductive hypothesis: For a rooted tree $T_r$, built up from $(T_1, 
r_1), (T_2, r_2), \cdots, (T_n, r_n)$ using rule 2. Assume the statement is 
true for all the trees $T_1, T_2, \cdots, T_k$ and prove it for $t$.
\item Inductive step:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Let tree $T_i$ have $n_i$ nodes, $i = 1, 2, \cdots, k$. Then $T$ has 
    $\sum_{i=1}^k n_i + 1$ nodes.
    \item By the inductive hypothesis, $T_i$ has $n_i - 1$ edges.
    \item Total number of edges is $T = \sum_{i=1}^k (n_i - 1) + k = 
\sum_{i=1}^k 
    n_i$.
    \item The number of edge is one less than the number of nodes. It proofs 
the     inductive step.
    \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
\section{Traversal}
Traversal: Visiting all parts of the graph.
\subsection{Traversal rooted tree}
\subsubsection{Post-order traversal}
\begin{itemize}
\item First traverse each of the children 
\item Visit the root.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Bread-first Search (BFS)}
Most of the cases, BFS is used to find out the shortest path from an unweight 
and undirected graph.
\subsubsection{Basics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input:Graph $G = (V, E)$; a vertex $s$ as starting point.
    \item Goal: Visit all the vertices in systematic manner.
    \item Intuition: Think of the graph is drawn as a pond of water. Drop a 
stone at vertex v and watch the ripple expand with great regularity The 
order of vertex visited in BFS is like the wave of ripples visiting the 
vertices.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Algorithm}

\paragraph{3 possible states for each vertex:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Undiscovered
 \item Discovered: Just find out this vertex and have not check its neighbors.
 \item Finished: discover the node and all its neighbors.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Queue:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Initialized with just vertex $s$. $Q \leftarrow \{x\}$. x is discovered.
 \item Work the follows repeatedly:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Pull a vertex out of the queue.
  \item Put all its neighbors into the queue as discovered.
 \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example:}
An example of BFS starting from vertex $x$.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{queue.png}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Remarks:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item In $Q1$, we did not put vertex $2$ into the queue since it is already in 
the Queue.
\item Vertices in queue are discovered.
\item Moving vertices out of the queue means it is finished.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Levels}
\paragraph{Definition.}
Associate levels with vertices in BFS: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item The starting vertex is level 0: $\text{level}(s) = 0$.
 \item Any vertex $v$ is discovered when dequeue some vertex $u$, we set
\[\text{level}(v) = \text{level}(u) + 1\]
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}
 The level of $v$ is the smallest number of hops to get from $s$ to $v$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
 Let $\delta(s, v)$ be the smallest number of hops from $x$ to $v$. Prove that 
for any $v$, $\delta(s, v) = \text{level}(v)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
 $\delta(s, v) \le \text{level}(v)$.
\end{claim}

\begin{claimproof}
If $v$ has level $\text{level}v$, there is a sequence of vertices $$x, ~v_1, 
~v_2, ~\cdots, ~v_{\text{level}(v) - 1}, ~v$$, s.t. each one discovered from 
the previous.

We have shown one path from $x$ to $v$ which has $\text{level}(v)$ hops. 
Therefore, the smallest number of hops should be less or equal to the number of 
hops in this path. Therefore, $\delta(x, v) \le \text{level}(v)$.
\end{claimproof}
\begin{claim}
 $\delta(s, v) \ge \text{level}(v)$.
\end{claim}
\begin{claimproof}
Prove by contradiction. Suppose among all $v$ such that $\delta(s, v) < 
\text{level}(v)$, find the one with smallest $\delta(x, v)$.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{level.png}
\end{figure}
Let $(s ~\cdots ~uv)$ be the path with fewest hops form $s$ to $v$.
\begin{align*}
&\delta(s, u) = \delta(s, v) - 1
\intertext{since $\delta(s, u) < \delta(s, v)$ and $\delta(s, v)$ is the 
smallest hops which less than level,}
\intertext{$\delta(s, u)$ must be larger than level$(u)$, i.e.}
&\text{level}(u) \le \delta(s, u) = \delta(s, v) - 1
\intertext{$v$ is the neighbor of $u$,}
&\text{level}(v) \le \text{level}(u) + 1 \le \delta(s, v)
\end{align*}
But we assume $\delta(s, v) < \text{level}(v)$, so we meet a contradiction the 
claim is true.
\paragraph{notes}
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\text{level}(v) \le \text{level}(u) + 1$.\\
    Because $v$ can be discovered early than discovering from $u$.
\end{itemize}
\end{claimproof}

\subsubsection{Remarks}
Look at edges on which new vertex are discovered. These edges from a tree and 
the discover sequence becomes the direction between vertices. Think 
of the tree are directed away from $s$, even though the graph is undirected.

Why it is a tree? Each vertex can be discovered at most one time. Every 
vertex at most have one in-coming edge then the graph is acyclic.

Will the tree contains all the vertices in the graph? 

No. The graph could have 
several isolated components. This is the expected result by design because BFS 
is used to find the shortest path from the source. So we do not want to find 
the vertex in different components because there is no path from the vertex to 
the source.

Will all the vertices in the same component with $s$ be discovered by BFS?
Prove by contradiction. There are some vertices in the component of $s$ that 
BFS starts which are not discovered. Among all such vertices, choose the one 
with the fewest hops away from the source.
% TODO: Prove it.
\subsection{Depth-first Search (DFS)}
The usage of DFS is broader than BFS. Explore one path as far as it will go, 
back track as little as needs. Repeat.

\subsubsection{Basics}

\paragraph{3 possible states for each vertex:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Undiscovered
 \item Discovered: Just find out this vertex and have not check its neighbors.
 \item Finished: discover the node and all its neighbors.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Data Structure}
\begin{itemize}
\item BFS: Order of exploration of vertices is the same as the order of 
discovery. It is a FIFO, therefore we use queue to track discovered vertices.
\item DFS: Last discovered vertex is the first to be fully explored. It is a 
LIFO, therefore we use a stack to track the discovered vertices.
\end{itemize}
You get a stack for free by using recursion because during the recursion the 
OS maintains a stack by itself. Therefore, we can think about DFS as a 
recursive algorithm.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}
$DFS(G, s)$
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mark all vertices as undiscovered.
    \item Start with s and mark $s$ as discovered.
    \item While there is an undiscovered neighbor $u$ of $s$ call $DFS(G, u)$.
    \item Mark $s$ as finished.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{DFS Tree}
Formed by the set of edges on which new vertices are discovered. 

\begin{theorem}
If $(u, v)$ is an edge in the graph that is not in the DFS tree. Then $u$ is 
an ancestor of $v$ or $v$ is an ancestor of $u$ in the DFS tree.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
% Should know the proof
Those edges are called ``back edges''. In an undirected graph you can only 
have tree edges and back edges.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{dfs.png}
\end{figure}
This cannot exist because $v$ would have been discovered from $u$.
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Time}
Suppose $u$ is a vertex in a undirected connected graph $G$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Time advance at each call and return of DFS function. The range of time 
is $[1, 2n]$.
\paragraph{Notes:} Every time you finish a recursive call of DFS, time advance 
by 1. Every time you make a new recursive call time advance by 1. Time is 
discrete and start from 1 at the first DFS call to $s$ and advance by 1 every 
time you finish or start a new recursive call.
\item $s(u)$: \textbf{The start time} of $u$ is the time at which DFS of $u$ is 
invoked.
\item $f(u)$: \textbf{The finish time} of $u$ is the time at which the DFS of 
$u$ is finished.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Duration}
It is generally true for recursive function that the duration of an vertex $u$ 
is the integral from the start to the finish time.
\[\text{Duration}(u) = [s(u), f(u)]\]
$\forall u, v,$ it is not the case that 
\[s(u) < s(v) < f(u) < f(v)\]
Recursive algorithm ensures that it does not happen since it is last in first 
out. $v$ should finish first before $u$.

\subsubsection{Lineage}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ancestor:} If you have a rooted tree, $u$ is call ancestor of 
$v$ if $u$ is on the path from $v$ to the root. 
\item \textbf{Descendant:} If $v$ is an ancestor of $u$, then $u$ is the 
descendant of $v$.
\item By convention, we include itself as ancestor so we allow $v$ to be its 
own ancestor as well as its own descendant.
\end{itemize}
\begin{theorem}
Suppose $u$ is discovered before $v$ and there is a path \textbf{of 
undiscovered vertices} between $u$ and $v$. Then $v$ will become a descendant 
of $u$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Prove by contradiction. Suppose it is not the case and look at the first 
vertex on the path from u to v of undiscovered vertices that dose not become 
the descent of $u$.

Look at the first vertex to violate the rule would be a good way to prove a 
contradiction.
% TODO: prove this theorem
\end{proof}
\subsection{Notes}
BFS is used to find the shortest path from the source in the graph therefore we 
start BFS from the source until we exhaust the component where the source lies.

DFS is also used to get a global picture of the entier graph and we often want 
DFS to be deterministic enough. We start from the source and do DFS. We only 
discover the vertices in the connected component of that source. But we want to 
discover other vertices. So we have a outer layer to restart the DFS from some 
undiscovered vertices in some other component every time we finish the search 
within one component. In this way, DFS is able to cover all the vertices and 
all the components. Therefore, often you only need to give DFS a graph without 
any source explicitly.

\section{Equivalence Relation}
\begin{itemize}
\item A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is an equivalence relation if it is 
reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
\item When the elements of some set $A$ have a notion of equivalence defined on 
them, then one may naturally split the set $A$ into equivalence classes.
\item If $R$ is an equivalence relation on the set $A$, its equivalence classes 
form a partition of $A$.
\item In each equivalence class, all the elements are related and every element 
in $A$ belongs to one and only one equivalence class.
\item The relation $R$ determines the membership in each equivalence class, and 
every element in the equivalence class can be used to represent that equivalence 
class.
\item In a sense, if you know one member within an equivalence class, you also 
know all the other elements in the equivalence class because they are all 
related according to $R$.
\item Conversely, given a partition of $A$, we can use it to define 
an equivalence relation by declaring two elements to be related if they belong 
to the same component in the partition.

\section{Undirected Application: Bi-connectivity}
Connectivity is important but sometimes it is not enough and we want some 
robust connectivity. So we introduce \textbf{Bi-connectivity}.
\subsection{Definitions}
\subsubsection{Bi-connectivity}
\begin{itemize}
\item A graph is called biconnected if the removal of any one vertex leaves it 
connected.
\item A graph is called k-connected if the removal of any $k-1$ vertices leaves 
it connected.
\end{itemize}
Examples of connected graph which is not bi-connected.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{bi-connectivity.png}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Articulation Point}
A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an \textbf{articulation point} (or 
cut vertex) \textbf{iff} removing it (and edges through it) disconnects the 
graph. 

Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a connected 
network-single points whose failure would split the network into 2 or more 
disconnected components.

\subsubsection{Bi-connected Components}
Bi-connected Components are maximal pieces of the graph that are bi-connected.

\subsubsection{Vertex-disjoint Path}
Two paths are vertex-independent (alternatively, internally 
\textbf{vertex-disjoint}) if they do not have any internal vertex in common. 

Similarly, two paths are edge-independent (or edge-disjoint) if they do not 
have any internal edge in common. Two internally vertex-disjoint paths 
are edge-disjoint, but the converse is not necessarily true.

\subsubsection{Relations on edges}
How to define the relation between two vertices?

\paragraph{Proposal:} If there are two vertex-disjoint paths between $u$ and 
$v$, then $(u, v) \in R$. See example (a) in the following graph.

The proposal does not work because the relation is not Transitive. In other 
words, if $(u, v) \in R$ and $(v, w) \in R$ it is not always the case that 
$(u, w) \in R$.
See example (b) in the following graph. $(1, 6) \in R$ is a false statement.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{relation.png}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The relation $R$ on edges defined as follows:}
\begin{itemize}
\item For any edge $e$, $(e,e) \in R$.
\item If $e_1, e_2$ are two distinct edges, then $(e_1, e_2) \in R$ iff there 
is a simple cycle that passes through $e_1, e_2$.
\end{itemize}

Assume $R$ is an equivalent relation on edges. The property of equivalent 
relation is it divides the set on which it is defined into partitions of 
equivalent class.

Assume $R$ is an equivalence relation on edges. R partitions edges into 
equivalence class $E_1, E_2, \cdots, E_k$. 

For a sanity check, if $k = 1$ then the graph is a bi-connected graph. 
% TODO: ? why
Define component $G_i$ as the graph consist of edges $E_i$ together with a 
vertex set $v_i$ consist of the every point of $E_i$.

A vertex belongs to more than one components iff it is not clean.

\subsection{DFS }
Assume G is connected, start DFS at node $s$, when $s$ is an articulation point.

\paragraph{Case 1:} Suppose $s$ has one child in DFS tree. In this case, $s$ is 
not an articulation point since the removal of $s$ won't disconnect the graph. 
See example in (a).

\paragraph{Case 2:} Suppose $s$ has more than 1 child in DFS tree. $s$ is 
articulation point because non-tree edges only go between ancestor and 
descendant. The nodes in subtree $T(v_1)$ and $T(v_2)$ are not ancestor nor 
descendant between each other. Therefore all the paths connecting $T(v_1)$ and 
$T(v_2)$ must go through $s$. Hence $s$ is an articulation point. See example in 
(b).
