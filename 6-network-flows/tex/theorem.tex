The preceding proof proves the correctness of Ford-Fulkerson. It also proves the max-flow-min-cut theorem.

\begin{theorem}
	In a flow network, the value of maximum flow is equal to the capacity of the minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

This is an important theorem and an example of a phenomenon called duality. It means that maximum value of something is equal to the minimum value of some other thing.
