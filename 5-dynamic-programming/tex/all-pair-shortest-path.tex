\begin{itemize}
	\item Input: Weighted directed graph
	\item Goal: Compute a matrix of shortest path distances between every pair of vertices
\end{itemize}

The entry $D_{ij}$ of matrix $D$ is the distance of the shortest path from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$.

\subsubsection{Adjacency Matrix}
Adjacency Matrix is a representation of a weighted directed graph,

\[
	A[i, j]= 
		\begin{cases}
			w(i,j),& \text{if } (i, j)\in E\\
			\infty,              & \text{otherwise}
		\end{cases}
\]

What is the diagonal entries of $A$? They are all 0s.

What does $A^2$ mean?
\[
	A^2[i, j] = \sum_k A[i,k] \times A[k, j]
\]
Let's define a new matrix product for graph,

\[
	A^2[i, j] = \operatorname*{argmin}_k A[i,k] + A[k, j]
\]
