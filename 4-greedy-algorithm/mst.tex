\paragraph{Input:} Connected, undirected graph $G \in (V,~E)$ together with a 
weight function $w: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$.

\begin{definition}
 The \textbf{feasible solution} is a set of edges forming an acyclic connected 
graph on all vertices.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
 The \textbf{cost} of a solution is the sum of the weights of the edges in the 
solution.
\end{definition}

The are problems for which the optimal solution can be pick by choosing one 
element at a time.

\begin{definition}
The \textbf{greedy algorithm} builds up solution as by taking the next element 
to be one of the optimal cost value that can be added feasibly.
\end{definition}

Most of the time Greedy algorithm itself is simple but it is difficult to prove 
correctness.
