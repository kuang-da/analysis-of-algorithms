\begin{definition}
\textbf{Optimization Problem:} Minimize or maximize some function subject to 
some constrains.
\end{definition}



Now we start with a special class of optimization problem:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Given a set of elements, pick a subset.
 \item Constrains tell you which subsets are allowed.
 \item Any allowed subset is a feasible solution.
% \item Objective function assigns a value to every feasible solution.
 \item Goal is to find a feasible solution with greatest/ least value.
\end{itemize}
